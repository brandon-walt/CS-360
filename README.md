The requirements and goals of this application are to provide a way for users to track their weight loss/gain journey. The main user needs this application was designed to address is a way to input their daily wights. 

This application required a login screen, home screen, add weight screen, and goal weight screen to produce a user-centered UI for this application. One way this UI successfully kept the user's need in mind is providing a grid view of the users weights on the home screen.
